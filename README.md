# WOW GAME

Making a word of wonders game using raylib library in cpp language.

## About the game
The game consists of 10 levels. When the words are entered correctly, they are written into the boxes and if all are correct, you move on to the next level. 

The shortcoming of the game is that when the same word is entered again, points are added and it moves to the new level even though it is an unknown word.

When the Exit button is pressed, the level and score information is displayed on the screen and the game closes.

## For the future
- In the future, I will try to fix this deficiency and may add extra levels.
- The game consists of Turkish words, I want to add different languages.

## Build with
- [Cpp](https://isocpp.org) 
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) the framework for cpp
